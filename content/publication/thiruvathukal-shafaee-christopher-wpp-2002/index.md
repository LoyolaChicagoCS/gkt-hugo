abstract: This book was published in 2002 and is now out of print. Full rights have
  been reverted back to the authors from Prentice Hall PTR (now part of Pearson).
  Web Programming in Python was an early book on how to develop web applications using
  Python via a more integrated, framework-based approach. It provides a self-contained
  introduction to Python, Linux, MySQL (database programming and SQL), and Apache
  Web Server. We get many requests to make this book available. The world has since
  moved on to many other web frameworks (with a great emphasis on JavaScript) but
  as authors are committed to preserving knowledge and long-term digital archival.
  We thank our past readers for their support. Please direct any queries to George
  K. Thiruvathukal.
