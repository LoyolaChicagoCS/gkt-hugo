abstract: Message Driven Computation (MDC) is a model of computation with which they
  have been experimenting at the Illinois Institute of Technology. The authors aim
  to prove the viability of MDC in practice for the expression of parallel algorithms
  and the implementation of functional and dataflow programming languages. In the
  paper they discuss their implementation of the Lucid programming language in MDC.
  The discussion presents a subset of Lucid which illustrates the principles of Lucid,
  Message Driven Computing, and the translation into and the interpretation of dataflow
  graphs.$<$$>$
