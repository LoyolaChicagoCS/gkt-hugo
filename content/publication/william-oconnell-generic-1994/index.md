abstract: Heterogeneous distributed and parallel computing environments are highly
  dependent on hardware and communication protocols. The result is significant difficulty
  in software reuse, portability across platforms, interoperability, and an increased
  overall development effort. A new systems engineering approach is needed for parallel
  processing systems in heterogeneous environments. The generic modeling framework
  de-emphasizes platform- specific development while exploiting software reuse (and
  platform-specific capabilities) with a simple, well defined, and easily integrated
  set of abstractions providing a high level of heterogeneous interoperability.
