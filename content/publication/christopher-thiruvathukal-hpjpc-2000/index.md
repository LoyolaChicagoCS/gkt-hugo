abstract: Threading and concurrency are crucial to building high-performance Java
  applications -- but they have a reputation for complexity. High Performance Java
  Computing thoroughly demystifies these advanced development techniques. It delivers
  practical programming solutions, proven design patterns, and a rigorously-tested
  code library -- everything developers need to build optimized Java software for
  technical, business, and E-commerce applications. Start by understanding how threading
  and concurrency can be used to solve a wide variety of performance problems, enabling
  the construction of more powerful networked applications. Master the Java 2 Threads
  classes, including daemon threads, thread control, scheduling, and more. Review
  the key problems of parallelism -- including deadlocks, race conditions, and synchronization
  -- and discover proven techniques for avoiding or resolving them. Finally, master
  advanced techniques for building optimized concurrent code, including Java monitors,
  parallel execution of subroutines in shared memory, and parallelizing loops.
