abstract: Heterogeneously distributed and parallel computing environments are highly
  dependent on hardware, data migration, and protocols. The result is significant
  difficulty in software reuse, portability across platforms, and an increased overall
  development effort. The appearance of a shared directory of unordered queues can
  be provided by integrating heterogeneous computers transparently. This integration
  provides a conducive environment for parallel and distributed application development,
  by abstracting the issues of hardware and communication. Object oriented technology
  is exploited to provide this seamless environment.
