abstract: We use the term ubiquitous supercomputing to refer to systems that integrate
  low- and mid-range computing systems, advanced networks and remote high-end computers
  with the goal of enhancing the computational power accessible from local environments.
  Such systems promise to enable new applications in areas as diverse as smart instruments
  and collaborative environments. However, they also demand tools for transporting
  code between computers and for establishing flexible, dynamic communication structures.
  In this article, we propose that these requirements be satisfied by introducing
  Java classes that implement the global pointer and remote service request mechanisms
  defined by a communication library called Nexus. Java supports transportable code;
  Nexus provides communication support and represents the core communication framework
  for Globus, a project building infrastructure for ubiquitous supercomputing. We
  explain how this NexusJava library is implemented and illustrate its use with examples.
