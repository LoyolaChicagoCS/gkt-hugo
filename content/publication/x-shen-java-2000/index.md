abstract: "Large-scale scientific applications present great challenges to computational\
  \ scientists in terms of obtaining high performance and in managing large datasets.\
  \ These applications (most of which are simulations) may employ multiple techniques\
  \ and resources in a heterogeneously distributed environment. Effective working\
  \ in such an environment is crucial for modern large-scale simulations. In this\
  \ paper, we present an integrated Java graphical user interface (IJ-GUI) that provides\
  \ a control platform for managing complex programs and their large datasets easily.\
  \ As far as performance is concerned, we present and evaluate our initial implementation\
  \ of two optimization schemes: data replication and data prediction. Data replication\
  \ can take advantage of 'temporal locality' by caching the remote datasets on local\
  \ disks; data prediction, on the other hand, provides prefetch hints based on the\
  \ datasets' past activities that are kept in databases. We first introduce the data\
  \ contiguity concept in such an environment that guides data prediction. The relationship\
  \ between the two approaches is discussed."
