abstract: 'This is the final report for the Ad Hoc Human Interaction Nets project.
  All tasks described in our original proposal have been completed: Hybrid-Hierarchical
  Micro-Databases, Query Optimization, and XML for Embedded Systems. After meeting
  with the program manager, Tom Armour, in Washington, DC, we were able to get a better
  perspective on the ad hoc nature of the solicitation. Armed with this perspective,
  we were able to complete two substantial prototypes to address the four tasks as
  originally written that works with Pocket PC and Palm OS devices. We were able to
  evaluate the viability of the Sharp Zaurus platform as well but ultimately decided
  to limit our focus to Palm OS and Pocket PC devices, which appear to have the greatest
  market interest and viability at the time of writing. Acquiring the hardware enabled
  us to make substantial progress on the ad hoc networking issues. In our networking
  prototype, which is based on the Pocket PC platform, we were able to take advantage
  of the emerging. Net compact framework and use it to build a distributed services
  and database framework. In this report, we will describe the two concept prototypes
  that were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of ad hoc human interaction networks
  and then proceed with a brief discussion of each task as written in the original
  proposal.'
