abstract: The Metrics Pipeline (Codename) focuses on metrics indicative of team progress
  and project health instead of privileging individual metrics, e.g. number of commits,
  etc. The Metrics Dashboard allows the user to submit the URL of a hosted repository
  for batch analysis, whose results are then cached. Upon completion, the user can
  interactively study various metrics over time (at varying granularity), numerically,
  and visually. The initial version of the system is up and running as a public cloud
  service (SaaS) and supports project size (KLOC), defect density, defect spoilage,
  and productivity. While our system is by no means the first to support software
  metrics, we believe it may be one of the first community-focused extensible resources
  that can be used by any hosted project.
