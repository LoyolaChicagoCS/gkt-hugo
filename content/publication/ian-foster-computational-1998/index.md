abstract: Emerging telemedicine applications require the ability to exploit diverse,
  geographically distributed resources. These applications use high-speed neworks
  to integrate supercomputers, large databases, archival storage devices, advanced
  visualization devices, and/or sophisticated instruments. This form of networked
  virtual supercomputers is also known as metacomputers and is being used by many
  other scientific applications areas. In this article, we analyze requirements necessary
  for a telemedicine computing infrastructure and compare them with requirements found
  in a typical metacomputing environment. We will show that metacomputing environments
  can be used to enable a more powerful and unified computational infrastructure for
  telemedicine. The Globus metacomputing environment can provide the necessary basis
  to enable a large scale telemedical infrastructure. Globus is designed in a modular
  fashion and can be extended to support the specific requirements for telemedicine.
