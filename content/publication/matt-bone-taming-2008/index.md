abstract: Processing markup in object-oriented languages often requires the programmer
  to focus on the objects generating the markup rather than the more pertinent domain
  objects. The BetterXML framework aims to improve this situation by allowing the
  programmer to develop a domain-specific object model as usual and later bind this
  model to preexisting or newly generated markup. To this end, the framework provides
  two types of object trees, XElement and NaturalXML, for representing XML documents.
  XElement goes beyond DOM-like automatic parsing of XML by supporting the custom
  mapping of elements to domain objects; NaturalXML allows the mapping of existing
  domain objects to XML elements using class metadata. Both types of object trees
  can be inflated and deflated by means of a common intermediate representation in
  the form of an event stream. Finally, the framework includes the XML Intermediate
  Representation (XIR), a lossless record-oriented representation of XML documents
  for efficient streaming and other types of data exchange.
