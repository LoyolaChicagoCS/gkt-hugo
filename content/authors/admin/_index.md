## Brief Bio

## Bio

Hi! You've reached the home page of `(Prof.|Dr.)? George Kuriakose Thiruvathukal`.
The regex syntax indicates that it is optional to use *Prof.* or *Dr.* when addressing me.
I am on a first name basis with just about everyone, which is a tradition passed on to me by my PhD advisor, [Thomas W. Christopher](https://tools-of-computing.com), who always insisted that I call him *TC* (tee-cee) from the moment we started working together at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1988.
Most people struggle with *Thiruvathukal*, so using *George* is not only encouraged but highly recommended.

The K. is to recognize my father, <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/theherald-news/name/kuriakose-thiruvathukal-obituary?id=23543366">Kuriakose Varkey Thiruvathukal, PhD</a>, who taught at [Lewis University](https://lewisu.edu) and [Joliet Junior College](https://jjc.edu)--after "retiring" from Lewis University for an additional 25-year career.
(I *hope* I can follow his act but still have a long way to go!)

The name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuriakose">Kuriakose</a> is a name associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Christians">St. Thomas Christians from India</a>.
While relatively unknown to Christians in the West, Christianity has been practiced in India since the 1st Century AD, where St. Thomas spent his final years.
Kerala is also home to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradesi_Synagogue">Jewish Synagogue</a> since 1568 AD. (I have visited it.)

Anyway...

So here is a little bit about me.
I earned the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://iit.edu) in 1995 and 1990, respectively, and B.S. in Computer Science and Physics (double major) with a Mathematics minor from [Lewis University](https://lewisu.edu) in 1988.

As a Computer Science major at Lewis University, I received the department's top graduating student award; 
as a Physics major at same, I was inducted into the [Sigma Pi Sigma](https://www.sigmapisigma.org/) Physics National honor society.
During the summer of my junior year, I worked with [Philip J. Hatcher](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~pjh/)  at the University of New Hampshire on a [NSF](https://nsf.gov)-funded summer REU program focused on compiler construction, where our tools led to the development of a portable Data Parallel C dialect inspired by the C\* Language used to program the Connection Machine.

My doctoral research focused on higher-level approaches to concurrent, parallel, and distributed programming with an emphasis on models, languages, libraries, middleware, tools, and techniques.
The culmination of this research was a book in Sun Microsystems Press and the development of a class library, which was cited as prior art and related work in [JSR-166, Concurrency Utilities](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=166) (a.k.a. `java.util.concurrent`).

Simultaneously with my doctoral studies, I worked in the computing and engineering industry from 1989-1996 for Technology Advisors (a private consultancy), Tellabs, R.R. Donnelley and Sons, and Metromail (now Experian).
Upon completing my PhD in 1995, I was a postdoctoral computer scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, where I worked with [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster) *et al* on grid computing and getting messaging middleware (Message Passing Interface) to work on the first version of Globus.

My current work addresses software engineering for science and machine learning; low-power computer vision; computational neuroscience; crowdsourcing to aid in classification and machine learning; platform studies/gaming studies; computing education; computing history; and [digital music](https://lute.luc.edu).

Beyond academic computer science, I have a strong interest in information technology; ethical, legal, and social issues in computing; entrepreneurship; and broadening participation in computing. See the [Software and Systems Laboratory](https://ssl.cs.luc.edu) for more details!
