Hi! I'm George. I am full professor of computer science and chairperson of same at Loyola University Chicago and visiting computer scientist (guest faculty/researcher) at Argonne National Laboratory.

I double-majored in computer science and physics and minored (almost majored) in mathematics at Lewis University in Romeoville, IL.
I earned a PhD in computer science from the Illinois Institute of Technology under the supervision of Thomas W. Christopher.
My doctoral work involved the creation of messaging middleware to support parallel and distributed computation on computing clusters and networks of workstations (mostly in C/C++ and Java).

My research and teaching interests include high-performance computing and distributed systems, programming languages, software engineering, machine learning.
I am also interested in the interdisciplinary computing and work in computational science, data science, and digital humanities and arts (music).
My recent body of work is primarily in the areas of energy-efficient computer vision and empirical software engineering.
My research  been funded by government agencies, including NSF, DARPA, NSA, and NEH.
I have also received research- and education-related gifts from industry, including Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

My academic career can be described as a bit non-linear.
From 1990-1997, I worked full-time and consulting positions in the industry and ended this early phase of my career as a senior member of technical staff and development manager.
I credit this experience for helping to develop the leadership and "office" skills required of a department chairperson.

At Loyola, I have served as undergraduate program director (in 2004) and as graduate program director (from 2004-2006).
Apart from my university service, I have been an editor-in-chief (EIC) of IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering Magazine (from 2013-2016) and Associate EIC of IEEE Computer (from 2016-2019) and chaired the Magazine Operations Committee (from 2017-2018) after my EIC service.
I have also served on the Publications Board, which oversees the transactions and magazines published by the IEEE Computer Society.

I am presently serving as a member of the IEEE Computer Advisory Board and as a Track EIC for the Journal of Open Source Software (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence track).

Apart from being a department chair and professor, I returned to school in January 2023 to study jazz piano performance with [Lara Driscoll](http://www.laradriscoll.com/), a talented French-American pianist and teacher. (She is my first actual piano teacher!) I have also studied jazz informally in the ensembles program at the Old Town School, including [Michael Nearpass](http://michaelnearpass.com/) and [Jack Cassidy](https://www.jackcassidymusic.com/) (and hope to be back there soon).

### Hobbies

- classical, ragtime, and jazz piano
- biking, running, walking, and basic core training
- cooking and dining
- reading and writing
- political science
