Hello and welcome! 
Â¡Hola y bienvenidos/as!

## Brief Bio

I am full professor of computer science and chairperson of same at Loyola University Chicago.
I am also a visiting computer scientist (guest faculty/researcher) at Argonne National Laboratory.
I double-majored in computer science and physics at the Lewis University in Romeoville, IL.
I earned a PhD in computer science from the Illinois Institute of Technology under the supervision of Thomas W. Christopher.

My research and teaching interests include high-performance computing and distributed systems, programming languages, software engineering, data science, and machine learning.
My recent work is primarily in the areas of energy-efficient computer vision and empirical software engineering.

My research has been funded by government agencies (NSF, DARPA, NSA, and NEH) and corporations (Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft). 

My academic career can be described as a bit non-linear.
From 1990-1997, I worked full-time and consulting positions in the industry and ended this career as a senior memeber of technical staff and delopment manager.
I credit this experience for helping to develop the leadership and "office" skills required of a department chairperson.

I have served as undergraduate program director (in 2004) and as graduate program director (from 2004-2006).
Apart from my university service, I have been an EIC of IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering Magazine and AEIC of IEEE Computer and chaired the Magazine Operations Committee after my EIC service was completed.
I've also served on the Publications Board, which oversees the transactions and magazines published by the IEEE Computer Society.

I am presently serving as a member of the IEEE Computer Advisory Board and as a Track EIC for the Journal of Open Source Software (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence).

## Longer Bio

Hi! You've reached the home page of `(Prof.|Dr.)? George Kuriakose Thiruvathukal`.
The regex syntax indicates that it is optional to use *Prof.* or *Dr.* when addressing me.
I am on a first name basis with just about everyone, which is a tradition passed on to me by my PhD advisor, [Thomas W. Christopher](https://tools-of-computing.com), who always insisted that I call him *TC* (tee-cee) from the moment we started working together at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1988.
Most people struggle with *Thiruvathukal*, so using *George* is not only encouraged but highly recommended.

So here is a little bit about me.
I earned the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://iit.edu) in 1995 and 1990, respectively, and B.S. in Computer Science and Physics (double major) with a Mathematics minor from [Lewis University](https://lewisu.edu) in 1988.

As a Computer Science major at Lewis University, I received the department's top graduating student award; 
as a Physics major at same, I was inducted into the [Sigma Pi Sigma](https://www.sigmapisigma.org/) Physics National honor society.
During the summer of my junior year, I worked with [Philip J. Hatcher](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~pjh/)  at the University of New Hampshire on a [NSF](https://nsf.gov)-funded summer REU program focused on compiler construction, where our tools led to the development of a portable Data Parallel C dialect inspired by the C\* Language used to program the Connection Machine.

My doctoral research focused on higher-level approaches to concurrent, parallel, and distributed programming with an emphasis on models, languages, libraries, middleware, tools, and techniques.
The culmination of this research was a book in Sun Microsystems Press and the development of a class library, which was cited as prior art and related work in [JSR-166, Concurrency Utilities](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=166) (a.k.a. `java.util.concurrent`).

Simultaneously with my doctoral studies, I worked in the computing and engineering industry from 1989-1996 for Technology Advisors (a private consultancy), Tellabs, R.R. Donnelley and Sons, and Metromail (now Experian).
Upon completing my PhD in 1995, I was a postdoctoral computer scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, where I worked with [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster) *et al* on grid computing and getting messaging middleware (Message Passing Interface) to work on the first version of Globus.

My current work addresses software engineering for science and machine learning; low-power computer vision; computational neuroscience; crowdsourcing to aid in classification and machine learning; platform studies/gaming studies; computing education; computing history; and [digital music](https://lute.luc.edu).

Beyond academic computer science, I have a strong interest in information technology; ethical, legal, and social issues in computing; entrepreneurship; and broadening participation in computing. See the [Software and Systems Laboratory](https://ssl.cs.luc.edu) for more details!

## Hobbies

Music (saxophone), trail running (non-ultra), strength training, soccer, hiking, nordic skiing, sailing, traveling (especially scenic driving on unpaved backroads leading to remote trailheads and campsites), current affairs, movies.
