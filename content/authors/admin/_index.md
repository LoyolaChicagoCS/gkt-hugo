Hello and welcome! 
Sali und willkomme zäme!
¡Hola y bienvenidos/as!
Ciao e benvenuti/e!

## Brief bio

I am a professor of computer science at Loyola University Chicago. I majored in physics at the University of Konstanz, Germany, and attended Rutgers University, New Jersey, as an exchange student. Prior to joining Loyola in 1992, I earned a PhD in computer science from the Courant Institute at New York University under the supervision of [Benjamin F. Goldberg](https://cs.nyu.edu/~goldberg) and [Martin Odersky](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky). 

My research and teaching interests include programming languages, software architecture, distributed and pervasive computing systems, and data engineering, as well as applications in environmental sustainability and other areas of social justice. I'm affiliated with the Software and Systems Laboratory (SSL), an environment for computer systems and applied software engineering research. My research has been funded by government agencies and corporations. I'm a co-inventor on two patents owned by Lucent Technologies, where I was a research consultant (1996-2000). 

I also served in various administrative roles, including associate dean of the graduate school (2005-06), department chair (2012-2018), and graduate program director (2019-20).

## Hobbies

Music (saxophone), trail running (non-ultra), strength training, soccer, hiking, nordic skiing, sailing, traveling (especially scenic driving on unpaved backroads leading to remote trailheads and campsites), current affairs, movies.
